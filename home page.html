            The Apeejay Schools bear the motto<strong> "Shakti, Drishti,
            Prajyan"</strong>. Our effort is to reach for the sky for physical, mental and
            spiritual growth of the child and the pursuit of excellence in all these fields is a
            relentless and a limitless quest. The schools strive to achieve peaks of
            excellence in the academic field as well in life itself through a large variety of
            curriculum and co-curriculum projects. Apeejay Schools help the child to learn
            while growing. We believe that before children learn to read or write, they
            must effectively be trained to communicate intelligently and with confidence.
            They must nurture a rational mind capable of comprehending the world and its
            happenings. We offer your child a chance to become a world citizen, with an
            aspiration to change the world into a better place for all. We feel that only a
            truly educated person can steer the desired change. Our motto enumerates
            the essential qualities of an educated person: Shakti - Drishti - Prajyan
            (Strength, Vision and Wisdom). Hence, Apeejay Schools offer a collaborative
            learning experience that crosses disciplines and merges ideas to create a wellinformed
            cultured person with new thinking for a new world. In view of that,
            our Schools encourage intellectual indepe~dence, open-mindedness, and expermentation. 
            Our priorities are humanity and growth.
            If one is looking for a non-traditional school that will expand one's worldview, 
            come and see how Apeejay Schools are creating a difference
